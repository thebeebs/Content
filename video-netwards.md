I presented this little highlight reel in 2011 after a video presenting training course with Blue Peters' Peter Pervis. I have since presented hundreds of videos, but this is the only one where I was dressed as Freddie Mercury.

I was dressed as Freddie due to the Rock theme of the net awards, by pure chance it was the aniversay of his death and I was in Soho... I have never been so popular or had so much attention.

We also had just had dinner at a garlic themed restuarant... Garlic food, Garlic Ice Cream. Let's just be grateful that this is not in in smell-o-vision.
