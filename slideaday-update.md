Since I [posted my SlideADay request last night](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/thebeebs/archive/2010/11/11/slideaday-help-me-produce-a-5-minute-presentation.aspx) I've had 2 responses, so the presentation so far is scripted below, is there something you'd like to add? At 4pm today I'll commit the first 30 seconds to video, so please get in with your suggestions before then.

To submit your one-line or whole 30 seconds of content about HTML5 just tweet it using the #SlideADay tag or comment on the [blog post over here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/thebeebs/archive/2010/11/11/slideaday-help-me-produce-a-5-minute-presentation.aspx).

Script So far:

With HTML5 it it now easier to embed video and audio.&#160; Simply use <video> and <audio> Element tags.&#160; Plugins? What Plugins? [SMILE].&#160; 'HTML5 is not just one vast thing but a collection of individual features and the HTML5 specification defines how tags interact with JavaScript, through the Document Object Model (DOM). 

With the DOM API you can build a rich user experience and now HTML5 includes new input controls like sliders, date pickers and email input type. Upgrading to HTML5 is simple by adding the <!DOCTYPE html> tag and allows the use of new semantic elements like <article>, <section>, <header>, and <footer>. 

HTML5 is already well-supported with Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, and mobile browsers already support canvas, video, geolocation, local storage, and Google already supports microdata annotations. With all these features HTML5 is here to stay and I will tell you why...'
