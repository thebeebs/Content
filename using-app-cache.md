There are many new features in HTML5 but in think that [App Cache](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/offline.html) is potentially one of the most important. App Cache allows you to create a manifest file that details all of the files your application uses offline. When you visit your website with no internet connection the files that you list will be available to your application.<p>Over on the IE blog they have a great write up of how they used App cache to build an offline [recipe book](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2011/09/27/building-offline-experiences-with-html5-appcache-and-indexeddb.aspx) it details how they used app cache and how you can use it in your applications too.
