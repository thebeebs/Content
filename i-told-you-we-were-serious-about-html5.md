Over the past few months I&rsquo;ve talked at a number of events about how developers should only have to write HTML5 once and it should work the same across all HTML5 browsers including IE9. To accomplish this we&rsquo;ve worked hard adhere to the standards laid out by W3C.<p>Therefore it was great to see yesterdays&nbsp;[<span style="color: #669966;">results</span>](http://test.w3.org/html/tests/reporting/report.htm) from the W3C HTML5 standard Test Suite which&nbsp;shows that&nbsp;all major browsers are performing well against the official HTML5 tests, it show that the industry as a whole are working towards the same goal of Web interoperability. [<span style="color: #669966;">IE9 Platform Preview 6</span>](http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/) performed particularly well in this round of tests, leading the field with the overall best results, however, it is worth remembering that the tests are currently a work in progress,&nbsp; so no doubt the numbers and results will change as more tests are added and browser vendors improve their implementations.

Taking a look at the test suites for [<span style="color: #669966;">NEWT</span>](http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2010/meet-newt-new-exciting-web-technologies/) technologies like [<span style="color: #669966;">HTML5</span>](http://test.w3.org/html/tests/harness/harness.htm), [<span style="color: #669966;">SVG 1.1</span>](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/Test_Suite_Overview), [<span style="color: #669966;">ECMAScript</span>](http://hg.ecmascript.org/)&nbsp; and portions of [<span style="color: #669966;">CSS 3</span>](http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/) I get a warm glow as I imagine a day when the same code will work across all browsers.
