A few days ago, [Seth Porges](http://www.twitter.com/sethporges) put up an interesting post on Mashable: [8 Things You Should Know Before Building a Mobile App](http://mashable.com/2012/02/02/how-to-make-app/). While, as the name implies, Seth&rsquo;s post focused on native apps, it got me thinking &ndash; how does his 8 questions relate to creating an HTML5 app? So here goes...<p>**1. What does it cost to make an app?**

Overall, with HTML5 the costs will be broadly similar to a native app. However, you may find your people costs come down as it&rsquo;s generally easier to find HTML developers than those for native apps. Plus, the resulting application will work across multiple devices &ndash; with some customisation &ndash; which could bring your total development costs down further. I wrote a more in-depth summary of my opinions [in a blog post](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/thebeebs/archive/2012/01/25/is-html5-cheaper-to-develop-with.aspx) a few weeks ago.

**2. What should you charge for your app?**

It is certainly more difficult to charge for an HTML5 app. But then again, go ask most Android developers whether they&rsquo;re seeing revenues from their efforts (alternatively, [take a look at this article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16066262)). As with Android, the solution will probably involve either an ad-supported or freemium model.

**3. When will you get paid?**

This very much depends on the model you adopt (see above) but you probably don&rsquo;t want to hold your breath if you expect to be paid just for download.

**4. How do you write your iTunes description?**

The simple, flippant answer is: _you don&rsquo;t_. But this, of course raises a wider issue of how you get your app in front of people. There are now a burgeoning number of app stores such as Intel&rsquo;s [AppUp Center](http://www.appup.com/index), [ZeeWe](http://www.zeewe.com/zeewe/web/apps/) and [OpenAppMkt](http://openappmkt.com/) among others. But certainly, you&rsquo;ll need to give careful consideration to how you market your app and create the necessary buzz and recommendations. The upside of course is that you won&rsquo;t have to give 30% of your revenues to Apple or demand that users jailbreak their phones.

**5. What&rsquo;s the best way to beta test?**

The good news here is that pretty much anyone with a browser can test your app. All you need to do is make it available to them. If you don&rsquo;t have a test team on hand then there are numerous companies online who will test your mobile sites across numerous devices for relatively small fees. As I haven&rsquo;t used any of these online services I can&rsquo;t recommend any but if you have a favourite do let us know in the comments.

**6. What happens when you get featured on iTunes?**

Well, again, you won&rsquo;t. Although you may get featured if you go to one of the HTML5 app stores listed above. Of course the real question here is about scale &ndash; if [Lady Gaga](https://twitter.com/ladygaga) tweets about your app, will you be able to cope? So it pays to ensure you&rsquo;re hosted somewhere that will deal with hundreds, thousands or millions of downloads. A cloud solution such as [Azure](http://www.windowsazure.com/) or [Amazon](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) should be part of your launch plans.

**7. How do you get press?**

Fortunately, just now, simply developing in HTML5 has a certain newsworthy aspect about it. You&rsquo;re already a bigger fish in a smaller sea. It won&rsquo;t last forever of course, but now is the time to strike while the iron&rsquo;s hot.

**8. How do you avoid the spam?**

This is probably not an issue you&rsquo;ll face just yet. Spammers are far more focused on IOS developers.

So those are my eight. How about you? If you&rsquo;ve built an HTML5 app, what do you wish you knew back then that you know now?
