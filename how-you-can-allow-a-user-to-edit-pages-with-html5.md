When a user wants to change some information on a webpage it's often very jarring to ask them to go to another form to edit the content. Users find it difficult to understand how the changes they make on a form will effect the resultant page.<p>Therefore it's become common practice to allow users to edit the content in place. It's easy enough to do this by switching out content areas with Form Fields however HTML5 offers us another solution called [contenteditable](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#contenteditable). It's not a particularly new feature, having been in IE since version 5.5 but its addition to the [HTML5 specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/editing.html#contenteditable) and now broad support means that you can confidently use it on your website .

[Jack Osborne](http://www.twitter.com/jackosborne) of HTML5 Doctor fame, gives a [great overview](http://html5doctor.com/the-contenteditable-attribute/) of the feature with a number of examples including how to save the edited content.
