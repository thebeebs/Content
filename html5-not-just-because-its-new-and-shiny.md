After my giddy excitement over the [Cut the Rope HTML5 game](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/thebeebs/archive/2012/01/10/cut-the-rope-now-in-html5.aspx), Rob Ashton&rsquo;s [comment](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/thebeebs/archive/2012/01/10/cut-the-rope-now-in-html5.aspx#10254977) got me thinking a bit more.<p>In some ways I take Rob&rsquo;s point &ndash; using HTML5 because it&rsquo;s new or shiny or cool isn&rsquo;t the best of reasons for doing this kind of thing. (Although I admit, I like cool stuff as much as anyone.) 

To my mind, the performance of the game does illustrate what&rsquo;s possible with a bit of ingenuity &ndash; and yes, I agree it must be carefully worked around. The fact that the experience is near as damn it indistinguishable from the iPad should, in some small way, show that HTML and JavaScript are capable of more than they&rsquo;re sometimes given credit for. Which, to my mind, is the point of doing this &ndash; and why developers should care about it.

In addition, it shows that games in particular do not need to be propped up by Flash to work. Take [Angry Birds for Chrome](http://chrome.angrybirds.com/), for example. While pretty much everything is HTML5, audio is Flash. If you&rsquo;re going to do this, you might as well stick with Flash. Instead, Cut the Rope uses [SoundManager](http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/) which uses HTML5 audio in the first instance and falls back to flash for browser [that have trouble with doing it natively](http://nerdplusart.com/why-is-there-flash-in-the-html5-version-of-cut-the-rope). If flash isn&rsquo;t available, you&rsquo;re not going to get locked out.

That aside, where I am in violent agreement with Rob is where he says &ldquo;it is a wonderful way to deploy games to a large number of uses across nearly all devices in a standard manner.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s this ability to extend the reach of an app that makes HTML5 such a valuable addition to the developer&rsquo;s kitbag. 

If the tech beauty parade at CES shows anything, it&rsquo;s that the proliferation of devices is in rude health. And while this feeds the soul of my inner geek, it presents a real challenge for developers. Now, HTML5 might not be the only solution but it is becoming a viable option for a growing number of these challenges.
