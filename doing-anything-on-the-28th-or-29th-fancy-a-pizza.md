In two weeks time I&rsquo;m going on my holidays&hellip; I was just packing my bucket and spade last night when I realised I was going to be missing the PDC UK Event.<p>Basically the UK evangelist team are getting together in Reading to watch a live stream of the PDC2010 event in Redmond and we are inviting anyone who is interested to come along.
