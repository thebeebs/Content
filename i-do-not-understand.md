When the Spanish conquistadors first set foot on the Yucatán Peninsula in 1517, led by Francisco Hernández de Córdoba, they encountered the Maya people. The conquistadors spoke Castilian Spanish, while the locals spoke Yucatec Maya, the dominant language of the region at the time.As the story goes, the Spaniards asked the Maya, “Where are we?” The locals replied, “tectetán.” The Spanish misunderstood this as “Yucatán,” and that mishearing gave the peninsula its name.Funnily enough, “tectetán” wasn't just misheard; it was misunderstood.  It simply meant: “I do not understand you.”
