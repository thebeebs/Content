I&rsquo;m going to the .net awards on Thursday along with the ubelly team and thought I'd quickly give you my predictions for the winners:

## &nbsp;

## Web app of the year - [Typekit](http://typekit.com)
<p>I'm a big fan of Typekit, I briefly talked about [earlier in the month](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/thebeebs/archive/2010/11/13/fonts_2D00_on_2D00_the_2D00_web_2D00_typekit_2D00_and_2D00_now_2D00_css3.aspx). I sadly don&rsquo;t use either of the other two services. 

Nominees:

[FontSquirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com)

[Mailchimp](http://www.mailchimp.com)

[Typekit](http://typekit.com)

&nbsp;

## Community site of the year - [Ravelry](http://www.ravelry.com)

Giving Facebook and Twitter an award seems wrong to me, they got their reward&hellip; Millions and Millions of users. So if I was going to give an award out it would definitely be to Ravelry. I&rsquo;m not a knitter myself but this is a wonderfully designed site and shows that if you take a niche subject you can stand out amongst the big boys of social networking.

Nominees:

[Facebook](http://www.facebook.com)

[Ravelry](http://www.ravelry.com)

[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com)

## Best API use - [Flipboard](http://www.flipboard.com)

When you see flipboard in action you can&rsquo;t help but be impressed. Couple that with their amazing website (that I recently showed you how to [recreate here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/thebeebs/archive/2010/11/10/how-to-create-an-awesome-scrolling-navigation-using-jquery.aspx)) and you have a really incredible product that deserves some recognition.

Nominees:

[Flipboard](http://www.flipboard.com)

[Hootsuite](http://www.hootsuite.com)

[Twitterific](http://www.twitterrific.com/ipad)

## Interactive site of the year - [A Girl Story](http://agirlstory.org/)

What a wonderful site. I showed you how you could achieve the [technical effect they use here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/thebeebs/archive/2010/11/02/how-to-scroll-video-using-jquery-in-9-steps.aspx), but what I can&rsquo;t do is explain how they created such a heart wrenching story. It&rsquo;s Emotional design at it&rsquo;s finest. If this doesn't win I will eat Ryan Carson's hat.

Nominees:

[A Girl Story](http://agirlstory.org/)

[Battle of the Cheetos](http://battleofthecheetos.com)

[Chrome FastBall](https://www.youtube.com/user/chromefastball)

I&rsquo;ve not worked with any of these agencies but ClearLeft&rsquo;s [dConstruct event](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/thebeebs/archive/2010/09/04/just-got-back-from-dconstruct.aspx) was so fantastic I have to vote for them.

## Innovation of the year - [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)

Clear category for me, the winner has to be node.js. I can&rsquo;t stand developing for android, but maybe I'm a little bias after working for so long on Windows Phone 7. Node.js isn&rsquo;t something that I ever see myself using, but I'm glad someone is doing it.
