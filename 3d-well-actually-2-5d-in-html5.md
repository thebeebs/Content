![image](images/2766.image_5A75B728.png "image")It's been released for a little while now, but I just wanted to make sure you hadn't missed this rather cool HTML5 demo that was developed by the National Museum of China. 

You'll need a HTML5 capable browser, I tested Google Chrome, FireFox, Safari and IE9 Beta. All Browsers except Safari were capable of running the site, however, IE9 performs slightly better due to it's full hardware rending support.

None of the code is Minified so if you want to see how they put the site together use the site tools to view the source (in IE9 press f12, In Chrome CTRL + SHIFT + I and in FireFox use FireBug)

**You can find the site here:** [http://www.visitnmc.com/](http://www.visitnmc.com/ "http://www.visitnmc.com/")
