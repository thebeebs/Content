![Border-radius](images/0880.image_6C2A3103.png "Border-radius")

I was chatting to someone on Friday regarding border-radius and box shadow. He reported that there was an issue with IE9 regarding it's rendering of Border-radius in combination with box-shadow. I tried to reproduce the error in the hope that I could produce a test that I could submit to the IE9 team and the W3C.

It seems, however, that all browsers that I tested were able to render border-radius and box-shadow correctly.

If you know of a combination where this causes a problem let me know.
