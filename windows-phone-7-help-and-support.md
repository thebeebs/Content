In my previous role I worked on a number of Windows Phone 7 projects. I thought I'd just quickly post a few places where you can get help if you need it:<p>&nbsp;

For technical support, there is an option for direct email or phone support from a Microsoft Engineer using our Premier or Pay-Per-Incident Support.&nbsp; Here are the details:

Microsoft Commercial Technical Support is available to provide support to developers interested in working directly with an engineer at Microsoft.

Pricing for professional support is as follows: 

<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody>       <tr>         <td valign="top" width="23">

         </td>          <td valign="top" width="220">           

&nbsp;

**_Response time _**
         </td>          <td valign="top" width="220">

         </td>       </tr>        <tr>         <td valign="top">

&nbsp;

_Always&nbsp;&nbsp; _
         </td>       </tr>     </tbody></table>

To begin a support incident, visit [http://support.microsoft.com/select/Default.aspx?target=assistance](http://support.microsoft.com/select/Default.aspx?target=assistance), enter &ldquo;Windows Phone Developer Tools&rdquo; in the Product Finder box on the page, and follow the remaining prompts to begin a support incident.
