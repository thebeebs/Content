For technical support, there is an option for direct email or phone support from a Microsoft Engineer using our Premier or Pay-Per-Incident Support.&nbsp; Here are the details:

Microsoft Commercial Technical Support is available to provide support to developers interested in working directly with an engineer at Microsoft.

Pricing for professional support is as follows:
