I use GitHUb to manage the content of my blog. The hope was that this would provide me with a central repository for all of my content and alow anyone to contribute.

#Types
I have a number of Different Types of Content, ideally you should pick one but you can have multiple.

#Categories
I use catagories to organise content, Ideally a piece should only be in one category but can be in multiple.
