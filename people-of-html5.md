Over at the Mozilla Blog [Christian Heilmann](http://hacks.mozilla.org/author/cheilmann/) (Former Yahoo, Now Mozilla Evangelist) kicked off the 1st in his &ldquo;People of HTML5&rdquo; series by getting together with Bruce Lawson from Opera Software to chew the fat.<p>The result is a really [interesting Video](http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/01/people-of-html5-bruce-lawson/) that talks about&nbsp; how Bruce started, HTML5 Doctor, NEWT, feature detection, the dream of the semantic web, web applications and a ton of other stuff. 

Chris asks Bruce at one point some of the sites he&rsquo;d recommend to Learn HTML5 and below are his suggestions:

[HTML5 Doctor](http://html5doctor.com/)

[Opera](http://dev.opera.com/)

[Mozilla](http://hacks.mozilla.org/)

[Script Junkie](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptjunkie/default.aspx)

If you have a spare 15 minutes you should really [take a look.](http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/01/people-of-html5-bruce-lawson/)

P.S. I absolutely love the&nbsp; Universal Subtitles that are used along side the HTML5 video player.
