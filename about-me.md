I’ve been a developer since I was 16. Having no garage, unlike my American counterparts, I began developing small sites, apps and hacks from the comfort of my bedroom. My focus back then was pretty much the same as it is now – finding new ways of solving significant problems.

Early on, this involved discovering how to send SMS messages for free by piggybacking on a service owned by HMV. (This was back when an SMS could cost up to 30p.) The resulting service – ZipSMS – grew to capture around 1% of all texts sent each day. It also caught HMV’s attention and, while they were surprisingly good about it, ultimately this meant the demise of that particular brainchild.

Since then, my career has followed roughly the same path – find stuff that needs fixing and then use technology to fix it. I've worked in Small, Medium and large Enterprises and my Longest stint anywhere was working from Microsoft for eight years as both an evangelist and Software Engineer. Today, I’m a Developer Evangelist in EMEA at Oracle.

I spend most of my time helping developers get the most from Oracle technology. 

While I work across all of our technologies, my particular passion is Cloud. I regularly speak and blog about all aspects of Cloud development and implementation. I’ve written articles for and featured in, NET Magazine, ZDNet, NOUPE, SitePoint, TutsPlus and Channel 9.
