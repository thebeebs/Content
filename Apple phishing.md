I got an email this morning that claimed Â£40 ish pounds was speant on my Apple account.

The email looked realistic enough and the cancel href linked through to a website called: 

http://www.callmarty.ca/app.php?email=myemailaddress@outlook.com. [Who is Lookup](https://sign.tcns.com/dot-root/whois.cfm?domain=callmarty&security=on&action=whois&http://www.tcns.com/alerts/ie.html)

That forwarded on to: 
http://www.securing561.idcaseapp875.co.uk/app/account/login.php?itunes=_connect-run&secure=2w83749283749827498787297. [Who is lookup] (http://www.nominet.uk/whois/?query=idcaseapp875.co.uk)

Which was registered to 1&1 Internet.

It was easy enough to report the email, however it isn't clear how you can report these URLs to hosters.
