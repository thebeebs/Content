Personally I like using [jQuery mobile](http://jquerymobile.com) for the projects I work on because it has [really broad support](http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0/#/demos/1.0/docs/about/platforms.html) and makes developing in browser mobile apps easy. To be honest though I haven&rsquo;t tested or evaluated many other mobile frameworks out there.<p>There are tons of Cross Platform porting tools like Titanium and Phone Gap &ndash; But for me, if I&rsquo;m going to build native, I'll build native.

I asked on twitter for suggestions and&nbsp; [MooTools Mobile](http://mootools.net/forge/p/mobile) and [Sencha Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/) came up alot, If your visiting this blog and you have a favourite framework, why not let me know in the comments.
