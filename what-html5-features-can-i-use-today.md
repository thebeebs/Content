I think I&rsquo;d spin this question around and ask you to think about the kind of problems you have today in your site. If a HTML5 feature can help you solve one of those problems then great, but I wouldn&rsquo;t go searching for features and then try retrofitting those features to your site just for the sake of it.<p>You can use sites like caniuse.com to give you an idea of how good browser support is for a particular HTML5 feature. However, even if a feature isn&rsquo;t supported there is a good chance that a JavaScript Polyfil is available to enable you to use a feature and have it gracefully degrade in older browsers. Last week I should a good example of this with [HTML5 Form validation](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/thebeebs/archive/2011/12/05/i-want-to-use-html5-forms-for-validation-but-what-about-older-browsers.aspx).
