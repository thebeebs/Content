This month has been busy and reader I am happy to tell you I am going on holiday
tomorrow.

Last week I was at Shrewsbury Museum working on a project to build an
intelligent Museum exhibit. By intelligent, I mean that it collects information
about your age and plays a different Audio description depending on your
demographic.

For the 12-17 age group, we play a faster paced more informal audio file, For
the older group 54-65 we play a more factual and serious piece of audio.

The fantastic [Emma Clarke](http://emmaclarke.com/) voiced the audio for us, and
she did a wonderful job of the brief. Somehow, she was able to capture the tone
just right, and you can hear the difference between the two recordings. Here is
a sample of the audio for the
[older](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AlEOpfeanUR1r8FwNt6IyE0scH0zRA) and
[younger](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AlEOpfeanUR1r8Fi1CDOVUEBIU88Vw) audiences.

Joe, one of the other developers on the project, gave me a jar of honey from his
bees, for my effort. I bloody love honey.

The week before I was involved in a Hackfest at Microsoft Reading. I was
responsible for leading the Hack with 3 of the 17 customers. All the customers
built a bot of some description. We had one that can tell you what medical
conditions you might have from a description of your symptoms. One that can help
navigate a SharePoint site with natural language and one that could build other
bots from JSON description.

I Also worked on a project to use the Azure Custom Seach Service to transcribe recordings made by Lawyers.

The 4th of April saw the first episode of a new show I produce called
Introducing AI. You can find it on the [Channel 9
website](http://aka.ms/introducingAI1).
