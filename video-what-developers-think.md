I worked on this video in my first year at Microsoft, we took a strategy of acknowledging the poor reputation amongst developers of IE6-8 in the hope that early on in talks (which is where I mostly used the video) I could reset the mood of the audience and talk about the future of our platform rather than our history.

It largely worked. My talks that used this video in the first 5 minutes generally went far better than those where I did not.
