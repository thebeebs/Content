In a word, No. The web is open and hiding your JavaScript away is next to impossible. You can make is harder for a user to read your code by using something like the [YUI compressor](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/) but ultimately people are going to be able to read, debug and use your code. This is one of the things I love about the web; I&rsquo;ve probably learnt more about web development from View source than I have any other method. I&rsquo;m not naive though and there have been many instances of people stealing others code for their own financial gain which sucks pretty bad, just the other day I saw that Andy Clarkes Animate.css had been [ripped off](https://twitter.com/#!/_dte/status/141256067085647874). Code obfuscation is really the only method of protection (and of course regular copyright laws) that you have&hellip; Personally, however, I&rsquo;d be inclined to trust that developers are more keen to learn from you rather than blatantly rip you off.
