During the Tech.Days Online conference that I spoke at last week around 20 questions were asked and I thought I&rsquo;d answered them all. However it turns out that I missed one, so I thought I would answer it here:<p>_Q:&nbsp; I can drag pins to my taskbar, however, when I click on them nothing happens &ndash; the icon highlights for about 10 seconds but then fades back to its original state.&nbsp; Any ideas what could be causing this?_

I had someone with a very similar problem recently. It&rsquo;s hard to know exactly what your issue is without seeing it for myself but the solution posted here solved their issue:
