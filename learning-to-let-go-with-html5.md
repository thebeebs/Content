While it&rsquo;s a generalisation, I think most of us in the web development community have an internal control freak just lurking inside of us. After all, there&rsquo;s so much that can (and generally does) go wrong. And you know that it&rsquo;s always the one thing you let go that&rsquo;ll come back to bite you.<p>With Flash, you own the experience. Every pixel and its exact position are determined by the designer. HTML 5 is different. With HTML5, you relinquish at least some of that control to the browser. This can be a bit of a culture shock for some people. 

Personally, I don&rsquo;t think this is anything to stress about. While it means you may not have complete control over the experience, it should also mean you&rsquo;re able to deliver a more tailored experience to your users. Primarily, this is because the browser understands their current, situation and context better than someone working in a dev shop somewhere.

A good example is video. In most desktop browsers HTML5 video will play and look how you style it &ndash; it will be the size you specify and will inherit the CSS properties you apply. But then there&rsquo;s mobile. On a mobile browser it&rsquo;s more likely that HTML5 video will play full screen and inside the phone&rsquo;s native video player. It&rsquo;s the same video but the experience now suits the context.

Ultimately, this means that users get a better experience and the designer does not have to have amazing powers of foresight to predict every last context their content may encounter. Now that&rsquo;s got to be worth giving up a little control.
