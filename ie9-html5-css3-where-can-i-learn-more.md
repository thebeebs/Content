There are some great resources on the net to learn more about HTML5 and CSS3 here is just a list of a few I find really helpful:

1.  The [MSDN IE9 feature guide](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/ff468705.aspx) shows you what's supported in IE9 and how you can develop for it.
2.  [Getting started with CSS3](http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/get_started_with_css_3/)
3.  [CSS Portal](http://www.cssportal.com/css3-preview/)
4.  The Opera software [Dev Site](http://dev.opera.com/)
5.  [HTML5 Doctor](http://html5doctor.com/)
6.  [HTML5 Rocks](http://html5rocks.com)
7.  [Dive into HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.org/)
