After the success of the [What Developers Think of Internet Explorer](http://thebeebs.co.uk/video-what-developers-think) we thought we would try and produce a more forward looking and positive video. Again, I largely used this video at the start of talks to establish a rapport with the audience. It got more than 150k views which at the time made it the most popular UK video in the company.
