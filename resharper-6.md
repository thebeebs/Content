I talked about [ReSharper 5](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ukmsdn/archive/2011/05/16/what-is-resharper.aspx) in the MSDN flash a few months ago. I find ReSharper an invaluable tool so I was quite excited to see the new release that&rsquo;s now in Beta.<p>You can get a [30 day trial here](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/whatsnew/) and it has some impressive new features.

*   Javascript hinting now has code completion, you can find Usages of particular functions and testing is supported via QUnit.
*   ASP.NET MVC 3 Razor support, which is great since I rarely use anything else these days.
*   Navigation is now easier and you can narrow your file search results by adding spaces between search queries .

There is more information over on [their site](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/whatsnew/), so go check it out and feedback bugs so their final release can be rock solid.
