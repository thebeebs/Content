Privacy is dear to many people&rsquo;s hearts, especially online. Recently, this has been brought into sharp relief with Google&rsquo;s [circumvention of users&rsquo; browser settings](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/02/20/google_bypasses_apple_safari_privacy/) and the much trumpeted change to their [privacy policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). Unsurprisingly it&rsquo;s generated [masses](http://www.networkworld.com/news/2012/022712-google-privacy-policy-256399.html) [and](http://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-57388626-285/five-ways-googles-unified-privacy-policy-affects-you/) [masses](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17205754) [of](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2091508/Google-privacy-policy-Search-giant-know-partner.html) [comment](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/03/06/why_google_privacy_policy_is_so_difficult_to_follow/) [and](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/29/google-privacy-policy-changes_n_1310506.html) [advice](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/mar/01/google-privacy-settings-controlling-information?INTCMP=SRCH). <p>For me, the current argument has highlighted a fundamental challenge for anyone developing apps and sites: _how do you retain users&rsquo; trust? _And while many developers will simply take the view that their job is to create the best app/site/experience they can, the big question remains: _for who? _

This is important, not just for UX reasons, but for more ethical ones too. Because as soon as &lsquo;who&rsquo; stops being users and starts being advertisers or shareholders, the temptation to ride roughshod over people&rsquo;s privacy mounts.

In reality, no matter how many safeguards are put in at the browser level, some clever developer will find a way round them. They&rsquo;ll serve up fresh cookies from local storage, or embed them in every facet of a site, or find some other ingenious way of getting round the &lsquo;problem&rsquo; of privacy.

Of course, privacy is not a &lsquo;problem&rsquo; for users (except when it is violated). By choosing the settings they&rsquo;ve selected, users make a clear and unambiguous choice about their desired levels of privacy. Once a developer ignores that choice and is found out, they break the user&rsquo;s trust. Then we instantly move from people seeing the relationship in give-and-take terms (where they will help to evangelise and improve our sites and apps) to one where they see it as purely take-and-take (where they&rsquo;ll rightly dump all over us in social media and leave). 

Ultimately, a breakdown in trust is not in anyone&rsquo;s best interests. And that&rsquo;s something all of us (not just those inside the Googleplex) need to keep firmly front and centre.
