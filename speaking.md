## My Bio

### First Person:
I’m a Software Engineer at Microsoft working in the Commercial Engineering Software team. Basically this means I spend most of my time developing with partners using our latest tools, languages and products we’re launching and getting their feedback. This is invaluable in ensuring we create the best products we can and that developers get the most value out of them.
While I work across all of our technologies, my particular passion is the Web. I regularly speak, blog and about all aspects of Web development and implementation.
I’ve written articles for, and been featured in, NET Magazine, Creative Bloq, SitePoint, ZDNet, the Microsoft Developer Network, and many more.

### Third Person Bio:
Martin Beeby works for Microsoft where he works on the Web, Bots and Cloud Development. Martin has been developing since he was 16 and over the past 19 years has worked on projects with many Major brands.
Martin has written articles for, and been featured in, NET Magazine, Creative Bloq, SitePoint, ZDNet, the Microsoft Developer Network, and many more.

### Short Bio:
Martin works for Microsoft. He’s been a developer since the late 90s and loves figuring out problems and experimenting with code.
