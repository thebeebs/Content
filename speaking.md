I’m happy to speak at pretty much any developer event. Here are a few topics that I’m talking about at the moment, 
but if you have a specific topic feel free to ask me, 
I can present on most C# or JavaScript topics. Contact me at martin dot beeby at microsoft.com

* The Web on Day 10000 - [Video of this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgcrKRgFpn4)
* Visual Studio and Apache Cordova
* TypeScript
* Microsoft Bot Framework
* What’s New in ASP.Net Core
* Running Apps in Azure
* What’s New in JavaScript
* A lap around Roslyn - Project Roslyn now called The Microsoft .net Compiler Platform is a complete renewal of the C# and Visual Basic compilers, exposing them as full fidelity APIs for everyone to use, and providing a great foundation for evolving the tool experience and the languages themselves. In this hour long session Martin Beeby will show you what the new compiler looks like, how to use it and what it’s capable of.
