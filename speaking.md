### The State of the Function
  
There is a real buzz in the air about Functions and Serverless software development, and there is an overwhelming number of platforms offering similar but different things. In this 20-minute talk, Martin Beeby will take a look at the various platforms available, give an overview of how they work, their different approaches and talk about projects that he has built using them. 
  
### The Web on Day 10,000<

It's been 9,700 days since Dec 1990 when the first website was published and changed everything. In this 45 minute talk I will pose one simple question: What will the web be like on day 10,000?

I will look at the future capabilities of browsers, devices and servers and how applications will be impacted by advances in those three areas.

Using live code and demos I will explore, amongst other things, Bots, Web Components, Web Assembly, AI, Language Understanding, Speech and Serverless application architecture.

### A Developer Primer on Blockchain
Come find out how you can build a peer-to-peer distributed ledger forged by consensus. Understand through code how to build “smart contracts” and build a different type of transactional application that establishes trust, accountability and transparency, while streamlining business processes and legal constraints.
  
### Workshop: Becoming the Dev Star.
The team at Oracle has put together this interactive workshop that I can now deliver at your company or event. If you are interested just get in contact on email martin dot beeby at oracle dot com.

In this workshop you will work together in squads to complete the mission – becoming the Dev Star. We will look at how you build Microservices and host them on the Oracle cloud.
